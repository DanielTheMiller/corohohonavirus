# Corohohonavirus - The Game

This is a simple 2D game, where you play as a medical elf, vacinating other elves to tackle the corohohonavirus.
You can play the game at [corohohonavirus.com](http://corohohonavirus.com). The game is still in the early stages of development.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.0.

## TODO:

- Make refill stations actionable
- Make refill stations despawn
- Add Sound Effects
- Limit too many refill stations spawning off-screen

## BUGS:

- Shooting an elf isolates them and then kills them
- Ammo bars don't reflect ammunition count
- Elves and stations are spawning on-screen
- Footprints dissapear intantly if an elf despawns (need to be referenced globally)

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
